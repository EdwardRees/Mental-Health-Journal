# Mental Health Journal App

This is a simple Mental Health Journal project. The idea is to create a simple mobile and web application that helps users keep a running journal for mental health related topics. This will initially consist of a Gratitude Journal, Affirmations, and a Mood Journal. As this is developed, these may extend to further features, but this is the idea for now.
