# Self Care Project

What used to be a Mental Health Project, this is now a Self Care project, with a theme of developing a routine around self care.

## Self Care Journal

A Self Care Journal with a server, mobile client, and web client.

## Mental Health Blog

A Mental Health Blog with a server and a web client. The intention is to integrate the blog with the Self Care Journal, but also have it work independent of the Self Care Journal Project.
