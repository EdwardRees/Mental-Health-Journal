# Self Care Journal

What started as initially a simple Mental Health Journal project, this is now a Self Care Journal project. The idea was to create a simple mobile and web application that helps users keep a running journal for mental health related topics. While this is still true, a new component in the form of Self Care activities will also be tracked. The journal component consists of a General Journal, Gratitude Journal, Daily Affirmations, and a Mood Journal. The Self Care Activities will help the user develop a routine with self care in mind.

## Notes from the Developer

- This is a revamp of the [Simple-Gratitude-Journal](https://github.com/EdwardRees/Simple-Gratitude-Journal) project as I wanted to redo it, redesigning it, and add more functionality to it. I also didn't like how it was all hosted on the app. So I'm redoing this project and having backend and frontend implementations.
